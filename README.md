WP-Airlink
==========

Inspired by Press This, share links across browsers

This is a proof of concept for an idea I'm mulling over. Far from complete. But have fun if you like...

### To use:
1. Install and activate plugin
2. Go to the "Manager" in the "Airlinks" menu (/wp-admin/edit.php?post_type=wp_airlink&page=wp-airlinks)
3. Create bookmarks from the bookmarklets

"Add link" will create a post of "Airlink" posttype.
"View links" will show you the past 5 links (with option for more).

### Future plans
- "Add link" **does not** work with links on sites with https.
- A browser plugin perhaps?
- Woud be cool if the "Add link" were accessible from the Global wp.com admin bar.
- The Link management page should give you an option to "Blog this" which would create a post with the link in it.
- Meta box for posts with a search and easy access to the links.
- Bookmarket should allow tagging, categories, notes.
